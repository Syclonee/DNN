# DNN
project 1 : DNN 
classification network - deep learning to computer vision
first - fit a network with few dense layers only 
after that append some conv layers , batch normalizations and max pooling layers
compre the results of the models withing loss and accuracy functions
learn how some hyper params can be effect on the network results
